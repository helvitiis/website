            <h1>Working with SVG in Inkscape</h1>
            <p>Read the NewtFire preferred tutorial on SVG <a
                    href="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/svg/index.html">here</a> before continuing
                with Inkscape. Alternatively, you can read <a
                    href="https://inkscape.org/da/develop/about-svg/">Inkscape's tutorial as
                    well</a> if you would like two different sources of reading material.</p>
            <p>First, you'll want to <a href="https://inkscape.org/en/release/0.92.2/">download
                    Inkscape here.</a></p>
            <img src="http://firebellies.newtfire.org/~quantum-satire/inkscapeTutorial/inkscape1.png" alt="A picture of Inkscape's download screen."/>
            <p>Choose the proper download for your operating system and install Inkscape.</p>
            <br />
            <h2>Mac OS X</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>If you're working on a Mac, there are known bugs and quirks including the use of Ctrl
                (^) instead of Cmd (âŒ˜) in the environment. Make certain to read the instructions on
                the download page as Mac users will also need to download and install XQuartz <span
                    style="bold">before</span> installing Inkscape. The download instructions for
                XQuartz are also on the download page.</p>
            <h2>Windows</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>If you're downloading onto a Windows OS, select "64 bit" and then "Installer in .exe
                format". You shouldn't need to download or configure anything else like the Mac
                version.</p>
            <br />
            <p>You can learn how to vectorize an already-made graphic with <a
                    href="http://goinkscape.com/how-to-vectorize-in-inkscape/">this great tutorial
                    here. It's a quick read and was really helpful.</a></p>
            <p>If you're aiming to draw your own graphic in Inkscape and export it as SVG, read on
                with these helpful tutorials I've compiled in one place.</p>
