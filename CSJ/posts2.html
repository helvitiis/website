            <h1 style="text-align:left;">Q&amp;A: Advice from an Indie Comic Artist</h1>
            <h3>Allyson Hall | 11 Feb 2018</h3>
            <hr />
            <p> In 2016, comics and graphic novel sales in the US and Canada totalled $1.085
                billion--a 5% increase from the previous year--and have been rising steadily since
                2011 according to Comichron, the largest public repository of comic book sales
                figures. Rising figures are due largely in part to online vendors such as Comixology
                (owned by Amazon), Graphic.ly, and DriveThru Comics--DriveThru Comics even offers
                the ability of printing digital comics through their store.</p>
            <p> Independent media has steadily been on the rise with the advancement of technology
                and the freedom the internet and networking provides. With the ability to publish
                and read comics online in a digital format, this allows artists and writers a
                greater window of opportunity for presenting their creative works to the world.</p>
            <p> Tom Rogers is a freelance comic and storyboard artist based in Oregon who, between
                juggling employment for the art of the Marvel TL;DR YouTube series, the gaming
                industry, and Patreon commissions, works on independent comics for a living. I asked
                him for an interview by email to answer some questions about the independent comics
                industry and popular comic Herald, which is now published by Action Lab
                Entertainment.</p>
            <p class="question"> What first drew you into creating comics as a career?</p>
            <p> I've been making comics for fun (and for my friends and family) for as long as I can
                remember. It wasn't until my high school art teacher, Mr. Sutton, specifically told
                me I could and should do this for a living that I began to seriously consider
                turning my hobby into a career. I also came to the realization that drawing is the
                thing I did best (and loved doing the most) so I had to give it a shot!</p>
            <p class="question"> Are there any comics you loved when you were younger? How might you
                have been influenced by them?</p>
            <p> My favorite comics as a kid were Spider-Man, Sonic the Hedgehog, Star Wars, BONE,
                and I'm not sure if this counts fully as a comic, but also the Captain Underpants
                series. My two favorite newspaper comic strips were Calvin &amp; Hobbes and Peanuts.
                All of these comics still hold a special place in my heart and have influenced me in
                so many ways. While I never copied an artist's drawings directly, the artwork in all
                of these comics subconsciously affected how I draw and see the world. Probably the
                most clear artistic influence on my own work is Jeff Smith's BONE series. Beyond
                that, I have comics to thank for my love of reading as well as my moral code (thanks
                to Peter Parker).</p>
            <p class="question"> What is your favourite part of working on Herald? Is there a
                downside to working on the comic?</p>
            <p> My favorite part of working on Herald is the collaboration with my creative team. I
                eagerly anticipate each new script from author John Reilly, who has crafted a unique
                character-driven sci-fi/fantasy epic. I love the writing for every character in the
                series -- my absolute favorite being Thomas Edison's (fictional) slimey lawyer,
                Mackleroy. John often asks me to draw very ambitious scenes, which I'll have to push
                myself as an artist to achieve. (Artists truly experience growth when we stray away
                from our comfort zones.) Dexter Weeks's work as colorist and letterer is some of the
                best in the biz, further enhancing the artwork and storytelling. I'm a big fan of
                his eye-poppin' color palettes which have definitely influenced my own solo color
                work.  The downside to working on the series is that, as a royalties-only indie
                comic, it doesn't make us creators much of an income (certainly not a reliable one).
                I've been able to earn a living as an artist through my other freelance work
                (recently, concept art for a mobile video game and storyboard illustrations for
                Marvel's YouTube series, Marvel: TL;DR, as well as an art assistant for more
                well-established artists) in addition to the support from wonderful people on my
                Patreon webpage (shameless plug: patreon.com/tomrogerscomics)!</p>
            <p class="question"> What is your process on working each panel to completion, and about
                how long does it take for you to finish a page?</p>
            <p> My process for drawing a comic page begins with 2 x 3" thumbnail sketches in which I
                make all the major visual storytelling decisions at a small scale. Next, I scale up
                the thumbnail sketches and print them out on 11 x 17" bristol board in non-photo
                blue ink and begin the pencil stage, doing my best to perfect the anatomy and
                perspective in each panel. If I'm having trouble drawing a particular character
                pose, I'll often ask a friend to pose for me and snap some pics for reference to
                improve the drawing. After that, I clean up the line-art either by inking over it by
                hand (I'm mostly a brush and ink kinda guy) or tightening up the pencils a bit
                digitally in Clip Studio Paint using my trusty Wacom tablet. On average, a single
                black and white comic page takes me a full workday (8-12 hours depending on the
                page's complexity). A single panel can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 4 hours (for
                a complicated establishing shot).</p>
            <p class="question"> Back in 2015, Herald was proposed as a television series to be
                developed though Romark Entertainment. Is this still an ongoing process?</p>
            <p> While the TV option with Romark has just recently expired, I still hold some hope
                for Herald's potential to be adapted to TV or film by another production company
                somewhere down the line. As my writer John Reilly puts it, getting an option deal is
                like buying a lottery ticket. Even once a production company has acquired the
                rights, chances are pretty slim that all the pieces of the puzzle will fall into
                place. The comic series is always my primary focus, but it would be pretty sweet to
                see Herald come to life in live action (or animated)!</p>
            <p class="question">Herald started out as an indie comic written by John Reilly, with
                you as the penciller and Dexter Weeks as the colourist and letterer, before Action
                Lab Entertainment became your publisher. How different is it working on an indie
                comic versus publishing through Action Lab?</p>
            <p> The biggest difference between self-publishing and publishing under Action Lab is
                their connections to comics news sites and Diamond, the largest international
                printer and distributor of comics. And of course, now we have some editorial
                involvement, which, I'm thankful to say, has been for the betterment of the
                series.</p>
            <p class="question"> Do you have any advice for college students that might want to
                break into the comic business or indie / web comic scene?</p>
            <p> A. My primary piece of advice is the most simple: draw every day! Even when you're
                not in the mood, crack open that sketchbook and put pencil, pen, paintbrush, or
                somethin' to paper! Draw from life, draw from photos, draw from your own
                imagination, draw from anatomy books, practice perspective drawing, but most
                importantly just keep drawing! Got a great idea for a web comic on your brain? To
                quote Shia LaBeouf, "Just do it!" (He actually did make a comic come to think of
                it...)</p>
            <p> B. More specific advice is to know the ending and plan out the major bullet-points
                of the plot. Even if your comic meanders a bit along the way, knowing the ending
                will give you a solid goal to shoot for. There are so many web comics that have been
                abandoned simply because the creators lost the drive to finish them and/or didn't
                know how to finish them.</p>
            <p> C. Make it short! While you may want your first comic outing to be a grand space
                opera, your magnum opus, if you can actually FINISH it, you can feel proud of your
                completed comic (which is easier to present to comic professionals). I would
                recommend making a 5-10 page comic at first and shooting for loftier lengths as you
                continue to complete more ambitious projects. As previously mentioned, a lot of
                comics get abandoned for one reason or another. Beyond not knowing the ending, many
                comics are abandoned due to a shift in skill level. Once an artist feels they have
                "one-upped" their drawing XP (am I combining video game metaphors?), they will feel
                the urge to either tear up all their older work or redraw it completely. This can
                become an ENDLESS cycle that you don't want to get sucked into. When a page is done,
                it's done. Don't look back! Done is beautiful!</p>
            <p> D. I highly recommend the following how-to books:</p>

            <p> E. There's much more advice I would love to impart to my younger self (and any
                aspiring comic artists), but I don't want to overwhelm your readers here. Feel free
                to have them shoot me specific questions to my email tomrogersart@gmail.com and I'll
                do my best to give them the lowdown!</p>

            <h1 style="text-align:left;">HEART OF GOLD</h1>
            <h2>An Indie Web Comic</h2>
            <h3>Allyson Hall | 2 Feb 2018</h3>
            <hr />
            <p> Heart of Gold is an LGBT+ indie web comic that began back in February of 2017. It's
                the brainchild of freelance artists Eli Baumgartner and Viv Tanner who reside in
                Vienna, Austria. Since publishing their comic on the web, they have been offered a
                position to publish through Sparkler, a popular monthly digital magazine that
                distributes comics, prose, and audio for free.</p>
            <p> The gist of the comic follows main characters Dunant, a priest, and Ionel, a career
                pianist. Ionel suffers from a condition known as Nystagmus, making it nearly
                impossible to play the piano as his vision is so badly blurred. The priest Dunant
                regularly holds 'faith healing' masses that Ionel consistently attends, hoping to be
                healed. However, Ionel finds that something isn't right about Dunant's blessings,
                and decides to investigate the matter.</p>
            <p> The comic features breathtaking art in selective color palettes and promises an
                aesthetically pleasing read blended with a story based on mystery and suspense. The
                style is reminiscent of paint on a canvas, rather than the traditional 'comic book
                style' many comics still possess today.</p>
            <p> Eli is the main artist and co-writer of the comic, while Viv applies the colors and
                lettering. The comic has 184 patrons on Patreon, and you can support them by
                visiting https://www.patreon.com/heartofgoldcomic. You can read the comic online at
                https://sparklermonthly.com/series/heart-of-gold/.</p>
