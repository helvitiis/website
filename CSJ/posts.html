            <h2>What Is It Worth To Pitt-Greensburg? Apparently A Lot.</h2>
            <h3>Allyson Hall | 11 Feb 2018</h3>
            <hr />
            <p> It isn't a secret that the Greensburg campus has been suffering recently from
                cuts--both to the class schedules and professor ranks. This hasn't gone unnoticed,
                and a need has cropped up in the Computer Science and Information Technology
                departments for a new professor or two. That's where the interviewing committee
                comes in: a group of professors interested in the betterment of their students and
                their skills.</p>
            <p> On the week of the 5th through the 12th of February, Pitt-Greensburg hosted a series
                of three interviews in Cassell Hall looking for potential candidates to become the
                next Computer Science instructor. Five individuals sat in on the mock lectures
                presented by the candidates: Dr. Dean Nelson, the Assistant Vice President for
                Academic Affairs; Dr. Wesley Jamison, now retired Vice President for Academic
                Affairs; Dr. Estela Llinas, Associate Professor of Engineering and Mathematics; Dr.
                Elisa Beshero-Bondar, Associate Professor of English and part of the Committee for
                Digital Studies; and Dr. Stacey Triplette, Assistant Professor of Spanish and French
                and also on the Committee for Digital Studies.</p>
            <p> Among these individuals, IT and CS students were invited to attend the mock lectures
                and provide their feedback through surveys in order to guide the hiring committee in
                a fashion that would allow students to truly have their voices heard.</p>
            <p> Dr. Beshero-Bondar, who teaches Coding and Data Visualization and is a loud voice
                for Digital Studies at Pitt-Greensburg, voiced her passion for the subject in an
                interview about the hiring process.</p>
            <p> "We have an interesting mix of people," she said in reference to the committee that
                sat in the mock interviews. She'd like to see the newly hired professor "work more
                across disciplines," a commonly referenced topic throughout the questions directed
                at the interviewees. As a part of the Digital Studies Certificate, Dr. Triplette
                expressed particular interest in how the candidates might work with students on
                projects, work as a team with other professors, and incorporate potentially new
                classes and concepts to the campus curriculum.</p>
            <p> One of the biggest issues Dr. Beshero-Bondar expressed in our interview were the
                budget allocations imposed by Pitt-Oakland. Her classes in Digital Humanities--a
                hybrid crash-course-coding-meets-English class--were potentially in the line of fire
                to be cut from the curriculum had she not proposed them as IT and CS electives. She
                reported that the Humanities were not the only departments suffering—the Natural
                Sciences department has also been struggling with the professor-to-student
                ratio.</p>
            <p> So, how does this affect the IT department? Professors are looking for more of these
                "hybrid," interdisciplinary courses to offer to students. Candidates suggested
                improvements to Introduction to Java and Javascript courses, proposed a Python
                Language course, courses in Ethical Hacking and Cyber Security, Algorithms, Logic,
                and several others that would provide a more diverse opportunity for CS and IT
                majors.</p>
            <p> Mark Raschiatore, a Junior, and Nick Pscolar, in his third semester at
                Pitt-Greensburg, are both IT majors. Nick began at Pitt-Johnstown as a Computer
                Engineering major before he transferred to Greensburg, and commented on the major
                differences between the curriculums on the two campuses.</p>
            <p>"There were more IT faculty [at Pitt-Johnstown], and they were more accessible. There
                was also an emphasis on the use of computers there instead of lectures, we used the
                computers a lot. They assume we know a lot here, but really we don't know a lot
                going into [some of these courses]."</p>
            <p> "The classes are good, they cover a lot, but I don't think they realize how much
                they expect from us," he said with a look of frustration after being asked about the
                curriculum at the Greensburg campus. "I think they waited too long to [hire a new
                professor]. We need professors that can give doable homework, and step by step
                instructions to help us get to where we need to be. Professors need to encourage
                students to help each other out more instead of letting [students] struggle." </p>
            <p> "We need professors who are more engaging in lessons and toward students," Mark said
                after being asked about what he wanted most from the newly hired professor. Mark is
                most frustrated with the lack of classes offered for his major and expressed concern
                about graduating on time because of the cuts.</p>
            <p> They are both hopeful that the hiring of one or more new professors will allow them
                to pursue their degrees while broadening their knowledge and heightening their
                college experiences.</p>

            <h2>A Coroner's job can't be appreciated by the dead, but it is drawing the attention of
                the living.</h2>
            <h3>Allyson Hall | 1 Nov 2017</h3>
            <hr />
            <p> KENNETH BACHA IS the first person to shake my hand as I enter the Westmoreland
                County Coroner's office. He strikes me as someone who is sincere, and possesses a
                warmth that you might find in a passionate sports coach or a teacher, rather than a
                man who deals with death and sadness on a daily basis.</p>
            <p> Television shows like NCIS, CSI, Bones, and others often portray a stereotypical
                figure of a coroner or medical examiner that is quirky, sometimes odd; a type of
                person that doesn't easily fit in. The job, too, is usually blown out of
                proportion--of course, television dramas are great entertainment, but for students
                looking to become a coroner, they need to be prepared to face the reality of what
                this career path actually entails. </p>
            <p> First off, the coroner doesn't actually perform any autopsies. Bacha says that
                another, medically licensed doctor performs all of the autopsies in Westmoreland
                County—the Coroner judges which cases should have an autopsy performed. He's also
                the individual in charge of retaining the cremains (cremated remains) of unclaimed
                victims, storing them in an office only he has access to. Bacha also states that
                many of the unclaimed bodies are donated to nearby universities for study in order
                to keep the costs down for the office. </p>
            <p> Since taking office, Bacha has dealt with over 1,100 drug related deaths and
                assisted with catastrophes such as the United Airlines Flight 93 crash on 9/11 with
                40 fatalities, and the US Air Flight 427 on September 8, 1994 with 132 fatalities. </p>
            <p> "There were body parts in the trees and scattered all around," he tells me as he
                describes what the scene of one of the crashes was like. "They had police dogs
                combing the area so that we could get it cleared for people to visit the site." </p>
            <p> It's obvious having a job dealing with the graphic nature of life can be hard, and I
                asked Bacha how he and the rest of the employees in the office deal with it.</p>
            <p>"We try to keep an air of playfulness in the office," he tells me while giving a tour
                of the various rooms of the building. "We take our jobs very seriously of course,
                especially in the field, but we also try to have a little fun."</p>
            <p> In the office, all of the employees are interning, current, or retired police
                officers—some from our own resident Greensburg campus. Bacha tells me that in
                Pennsylvania, a coroner must attend the police academy first in order to hold the
                position. He also tells me they carry their guns and their badges at all times
                thanks to Act 235, which they petitioned for after a series attacks by physical
                force and even at knifepoint. Not only are the employees subject to physical
                altercations, but they deal with bodies that have flammable and caustic substances
                on them in differing stages of decay--a separate building is necessary to house
                these corpses for the safety of those involved with dealing with them.</p>
            <p> As it turns out, Mr. Bacha is a fan of hunting, fishing, and the outdoors. He
                started off working at a grocery warehouse, transitioned to safety engineering, then
                worked as a safety consultant. He's a big animal lover, enjoys volunteer work, and
                his favorite part of being a coroner is supporting those who are suffering in their
                greatest times of need. Perhaps it's natural that his job title sticks out in the
                description of this individual, as he's such a normal character. Perhaps we should
                take a step back from the television dramas and dig into the true facts--we might
                learn a thing or two about life.</p>
