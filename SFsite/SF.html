                <h2>SCIENCE FICTION RESEARCH AND CREATIVE ADAPTATION</h2>
                <p>Science fiction is "a form of fiction that draws imaginatively on scientific
                    knowledge and speculation in its plot, setting, theme, etc." according to its
                    official definition on Dictionary.com. While this is true, science fiction is
                    comprised of many different sub-genres and brings hundreds of different facets
                    to the table. Writers such as H.G. Wells with <span style="font-style:italic;"
                        >War of the Worlds</span> and Octavia Butler with <span
                        style="font-style:italic;">Lilith's Brood</span> deal with the technology of
                    aliens and play with alternate timelines. It can seem like cosmic horror and
                    space are often the running veins of many science fiction novels, books, and
                    other types of media, but there are also many exceptions to this line of
                    thought. <span style="font-style:italic;">Do Androids Dream of Electric
                        Sheep?</span> by Philip K. Dick briefly mentions colonies on Mars, but the
                    central focus of the plot is on Earth, while <span style="font-style:italic;"
                        >Watchmen</span> by Alan Moore has a similar focus (with brief mentions of
                    Dr. Manhattan on Mars. Mars is a popular planet in science fiction). <span
                        style="font-style:italic;">The Handmaid's Tale</span> by Margaret Atwood has
                    hardly any mention if at all of technological advancement--Offred's story is
                    recorded on cassette tapes. Though not all science fiction pieces deal with
                    technology, many do--including <span style="text-style:italic;">2001</span>.
                    Gary Leonard puts this simply:</p>
                <p style="padding-right: 10%; padding-left: 10%;"> Although Science Fiction
                    extensively features various products of technology, and might fairly be said to
                    show an obsession with gadgets, it is not really the buttons, dials, and gizmos
                    that drive this genre. What seems of more interest is the way these things
                    reflect a way of thinking, and a method for ordering and organizing the world
                    around us, that then serves as the ground permitting us to perceive humanity as
                    moving in a direction we characterize as moving "forward." The perception of
                    this direction as "forward," thereby constituting "progress," is dependent on
                    seeing the gadget as a "new" invention predicated on a "discovery." Discovery
                    and progress are conflated into a general notion of "progress".<sup

                <p>Hal is a machine. It's clear that Arthur C. Clarke intended for Hal to be
                    something more than this though, as he inadvertently breaks Isaac Asimov's three
                    laws of robotics to prove a point in the novel (perhaps at no fault of his own):
                    1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human
                    being to come to harm; 2) A robot must obey orders given it by human beings
                    except where such orders would conflict with the First Law; and, 3) A robot must
                    protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the
                    First or Second Law. <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a
                            href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> Though it's easy to say Hal followed
                    the third law, the first and second are broken as Hal makes the choice not to
                    save Poole in Chapter 25 of <span style="font-style:italic;">2001</span>.<sup
                        id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> It's
                    also fair to say Hal doesn't qualify as a robot because of his heightened
                    intelligence. This may be a valid statement, but some points can be argued that
                    Hal is, indeed, qualified to be labelled as a robot--more specifically an
                    artificially intelligent robot. Hal is able to be programmed, yet is also able
                    to learn on his own via particular algorithms.<sup id="cite_ref-3"
                        class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> From Nathan Abrams'
                    article entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">What was HAL? IBM, Jewishness
                        and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey,</span></p>
                <p style="padding-right: 10%; padding-left: 10%;">"HAL has been described as more
                    human than any of the astronauts in the film. HAL is, in theory, capable of
                    emotional responses indistinguishable from those displayed by his human
                    counterparts but many have commented that HAL appears more rounded and
                    sympathetic than they do. For example, when Poole receives birthday greetings
                    from his distant parents on Earth, he appears to be bored. Furthermore, we
                    experience events from HAL's subjective point of view; in fact, we are even
                    invited inside HAL's mind and memory, learning of his 'childhood' and 'birth',
                    as well as physically entering his 'brain'. As a consequence of this
                    personalization and individuation, 'the audience feels sympathy for HAL when he
                    is finally disconnected. None of the other characters in the film is ever
                    presented with this degree of empathy'."<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"
                            ><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
                <p>Abrams agrees that Hal must be more than a machine, which makes sense in the
                    context Clarke presents.</p>
                <p>In the first few sentences in Chapter 3 of <span style="font-style:italic;">2010:
                        odyssey two,</span> Dr. Chandra is introduced as being so passionate about
                    Hal that, as he learns of the deaths of the Discovery crew, he "griev[es] only
                    for his lost child, HAL 9000." Dr. Chandra's unremitting reverence toward Hal
                    during his development and learning period may be a contributing factor to Hal's
                    aberrent behavior which puzzles everyone (including his creator). Abrams helps
                    to support this claim that Hal must have a connection to humans harbored,
                    perhaps originally, by Dr. Chandra. "...when HAL refers to Bowman as 'Dave'
                    rather than 'David'," Abrams writes, "this has the effect of indicating
                    friendship and familiarity, even intimacy, between man and computer..." </p>
                <p>When I went about deriving a seperate work of fiction from Kubrick and Clarke's
                    alternate world, I wanted to make certain I was able to understand the
                    characters and their motivations, which I knew would be difficult in the format
                    I chose to present the adaptation. It's not easy to show how a character feels
                    by only revealing their words, but I felt it would be crucial to reveal the
                    situation from Hal's point of view. He recieves raw data and must learn to sift
                    through it, draw out the crucial points that he can build on, and learn from his
                    mistakes or successes. Here, I'm forcing the reader to deal with the same kind
                    of blinders Hal has, or for that regard, any self-aware object equipped with the
                    technology of intelligence and machine learning today.</p>
                <p>Clarke's background as a trained physicist and mathematician allowed him a
                    mindset to delve into "hard science fiction," characterized by precise and
                    scientifically accurate themes and world building.<sup id="cite_ref-5"
                        class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6"
                        class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> This should be
                    observed when attempting an adaptation from his work, which I faithfully
                    undertook; part of my future career path involves scientific writing on
                    technology, and so with the credentials I hold in that regard, I set to work
                    expanding on Hal's character and motivation. He is seemingly proud of himself
                    and holds himself to a high standard, and as an intelligent machine is able to
                    process information in a way that gives him the illusion of being a living
                    being. There are ethics and debates that aren't necessary to get into now, but
                    for all purposes in <span style="font-style:italic;">2001</span>, Hal <span
                        style="font-style:italic;">thinks</span> and <span
                        style="font-style:italic;">chooses</span> his responses to situations based
                    on facts and his given input. It's also important to note that Hal is given a
                    gender and referred to as "he" or "him," which personifies him from simply "an
                    AI."</p>
                <p>On a stylistic side note, I designed the adaptation page to resemble a CTR
                    monitor similar to those used in the late seventies onward until the 2000s, and
                    I crafted the text to look like a data sheet that could have been pulled from
                    Hal's memory banks. A lot of it will seem a little odd or out of place--this is
                    because Hal's memory banks have already been removed by Dave at this point, and
                    we are taking Hal's memories at face value. It is noted in 2001 that Hal's
                    memories may have been wiped all but for a few, and so I used this idea to build
                    upon for my project.</p>
