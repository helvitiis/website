            <h1>What is CI?</h1>
            <p>Continuous Integration or CI allows a project team to record committed changes and
                run tests over those changed files to make certain their work is considered valid.
                It protects the project from invalidity or well-formedness errors by giving a
                particular set of indicators.</p>
            <p>For example, if a team member pushes an XML file with a well-formedness error, the
                Continuous Delivery or CD tool will send up a "red flag."</p>

            <h1>Implimenting a CD Tool into a GitHub Project Repo</h1>

            <p>One of the most popular CI tools in use by open-source projects on GitHub is called
                    <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/travis-ci">Travis CI,</a> free to use as
                long as your project is open-source. If your project isn't open-source, its base
                price is a $69 per-month subscription fee good for one project.</p>

            <img src="travisci.png" alt="A picture of TravisCI's implimentation screen." />

            <p>In order to impliment Travis CI into your project's repo, you'll need to scroll down
                on the GitHub Marketplace app page until you see this:</p>

            <img src="travciprice.png" alt="A picture of TravisCI's buying screen." />

            <p>Click on the green "Install it for free" button, which takes you to a payment screen.
                Don't worry--you won't need to make any payments or put in any card information!
                (Unless you are planning on purchasing a subscription fee.) Continue with the
                "payment processing" window:</p>

            <img src="travcipay.png" alt="A picture of TravisCI's payment screen." />

            <p>You'll want to impliment the tool into the proper repo after this, or you can choose
                to impliment the tool into all of your repositories. Be careful not to impliment the
                tool on any repositories that aren't open-source projects, otherwise this will break
                the terms of use agreement with the free option for Travis CI.</p>

            <p>You should now be taken to a page that looks similar to this:</p>

            <img src="travhome.png" alt="A picture of TravisCI's initial home screen." />

            <p>Now, we're going to take a break from working directly with Travis CI and download
                another program that will allow us to actually use Travis CI.</p>

            <h1>Downloading ngrok</h1>

            <p>In order to set up Travis CI with our repository, we want to use <a
                    href="https://ngrok.com">ngrok,</a> a program designed to expose our local host
                to the Internet. It's important to follow these directions exactly in order to get
                everything to work properly.</p>

            <img src="ngrokhome.png" alt="A picture of ngrok's download screen." />

            <h2>Working with ngrok</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Download ngrok.</li>
                <li>Unzip the file into the user file. <span style="font-weight:bold;">If on a Mac:
                        /Users/[username]</span></li>
                <li>Run the following command in Terminal: <code>./ngrok authtoken 3PB7HriDFtqrBze9ETiht_5fX5qqUDEE4Q5XT2zup7Z</code></li>
                <li>Run <code>./ngrok help</code> in Terminal.</li>
                <li>Run <code>./ngrok http 80</code>. You should now see a layout similar to this screen in your Terminal:</li>
                <img src="ngrokterminal.png" style="height:70%; width:70%;" alt="A picture of ngrok's terminal layout." />
                <li>Open http://localhost:4040 in your browser. You should see a page similar to this:</li>
                <img src="displaybrowserngrok.png" style="height:70%; width:70%;" alt="A picture of ngrok's browser layout." />
            </ol>

            <h2>Mac OS X</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>If you're working on a Mac, there are known bugs and quirks including the use of Ctrl
                (^) instead of Cmd (âŒ˜) in the environment. Make certain to read the instructions on
                the download page as Mac users will also need to download and install XQuartz <span
                    style="bold">before</span> installing Inkscape. The download instructions for
                XQuartz are also on the download page.</p>
            <h2>Windows</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>If you're downloading onto a Windows OS, select "64 bit" and then "Installer in .exe
                format". You shouldn't need to download or configure anything else like the Mac
                version.</p>
            <br />
            <p>You can learn how to vectorize an already-made graphic with <a

                    here. It's a quick read and was really helpful.</a></p>
